----------------

Answer the questions from the lab description here.  Questions 8 and 9 do not require answers.

1.TupleIterator, Operator, SeqScan
2.Aggregate, Delete, Filter, HashEquiJoin, Insert, Join, OrderBy, Project
3.select, project, join
4.It inherits these methods from the class Operator since it's a subclass of Operator.
5.
while (iter.hasNext()):
	t = iterR.next()
	if t matches predicate:
		return iterR.next()
return null
6.
list = []
while iterR.hasNext():
    t1 = iterR.next()
    while iterS.hasNext():
	t2 = iterS.next()
        if t1 and t2 match join predicate:
            tNew = merge(t1, t2)   # create a new tuple repr. the join
            list.append( tNew )
    iterS.rewind()
return list

7.
if iterR.hasNext()&&t1==null
    t1 = iterR.next()
while (iterR.hasNext())||(iterS.hasNext())
    while (iterS.hasNext()):
        t2 = iterS.next()
        if t1 and t2 match join predicate:
            tNew = merge(t1, t2)   # create a new tuple repr. the join
            return tNew
    if iterR.hasNext()
        t1 = iterR.next()
        iterS.rewind()
return null
