Report for Lab 6
----------------

Exercise 1.

1. Briefly explain how logging is done in SimpleDB by describing when log records are written to the log.  Use Eclipse search tools to find all uses of the LogFile methods in the SimpleDB source code.

    When a page is flushed, an entry is inserted into the log. The log is also called during the different stages of a transaction (begin, abort or commit).


2. Where is LogFile.force called?  You should include usages inside other LogFile methods.  For each usage, why is it important that force is called?

    The LogFile.force method is called whenever a logAbort or logCommit method is called (i.e. when a transaction is aborted or commit and the event is logged). This ensure that we know exactly the state of commit (or abort) up to the most current transaction in the event of a failure where we need to perform recovery. In addition, when a page is flushed to disk, the force method is also called so we can keep track when the page is flushed to disk in relation all the other events.


3. Where is setBeforeImage image called?  

    It is only called when a transaction committed successfully. In this case, any page that was dirtied by the transaction will set its beforeImage as its current state (since the transaction was successful).


Exercise 4.

In answering the next few questions, oncy include method calls in the source code; method calls in the test code can be ignored.

4. Where is BufferPool.flushPage called?  
    
    When a transaction commits or when we need to evict a page.

5. Where is BufferPool.flushPages(tid) called?

    It is called when a transaction is committed or aborted.

6. Where is BufferPool.flushAllPages called?

    It is called when a checkpoint is recorded.

7. To support a NO FORCE, STEAL policy, describe exactly when/where pages should be flushed to disk.

    Pages should only be flushed to disk when a checkpoint is created. Everything else should be recorded in the log and the database should take care of this when refer to the recovery algorithm to make sure itâ€™s in a consistent state


After you complete the lab, please answer the following questions.  

8. What is your name?  If you work with a partner, be sure to write both of your names.

    Andy Dau

9. What did you think of this assignment?

    The last part about no force and steal is a bit unclear. I only changed the logic of when a page is flushed or evicted and every tests passes but it still does not not make a lot of sense.

10. What was the hardest part of this assignment?

    The last part of the lab is rather unclear. All the materials seems to say that ARIES should automatically support no force, steal but I think there has to be more work to be done than just changing when a page is flushed.

11. Describe any missing or incomplete elements of your code.

    If the last part cause any problem that you may see, you could revert to the previous version of the code which should work fine with force, no steal.

12. Roughly how long did you spend working on this lab?

    About 5 hours.
